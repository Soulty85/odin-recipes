    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        You'll love this grits casserole with ground sausage and cheese, especially if you're from the South. When I cook it, I place it in the slow cooker to stay warm. There is nothing worse than cold grits for breakfast!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked grits</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish. </li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; stir in grits. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until liquid has been absorbed, about 5 minutes. Mix in 2 cups Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the butter until melted.</li>
